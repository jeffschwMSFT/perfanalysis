This repo contains a handful of simple apps that exhibit poor performance and two projects on how to do in-process or out-of-process analysis.  The intention is that these samples are used as a teaching tool and as such are partial and are completed as part of the learning.

Other great samples that highlight diagnosable issues are:
 * [Diagnostic Walkthroughs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics)
 * [Diagnostics Source](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/core/diagnostics/DiagnosticScenarios)
 * [AspNetCore Diagnostics](https://github.com/davidfowl/AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios)
